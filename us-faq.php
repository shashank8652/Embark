                              construction workers may be eligible for the H-2B visa, which is for temporary non-
                              agricultural workers. This visa allows individuals to work in the U.S. for a temporary period,
                              typically for a season, peak load need, or one-time occurrence.
                           </li>
                           <li>The maximum period of stay allowed under the H-2B visa is 3 years. After that, the visa
                              holder must leave the U.S. for an uninterrupted period of 3 months before seeking
                              read mission under the H-2B program.

                              employer for temporary work, and the employer must obtain a temporary labor certification
                              from the Department of Labor. Additionally, the job must be temporary in nature, and there
                              must be a shortage of U.S. workers who are able, willing, qualified, and available to do the

                        <p class="fs18 lineheight33 mb15 poppins brand-color"> 1. EB-3 Visa Overview:</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>The EB-3 (Employment-Based Third Preference) visa category is for
                              individuals seeking permanent residency (a green card) in the U.S.
                           </li>
                           <li>It includes three subcategories: skilled workers, professionals, and other
                              workers (unskilled workers).
                           </li>

                        <p class="fs18 lineheight33 mb15 comfortaa">To qualify for the EB-3 visa as an unskilled worker:</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>You must demonstrate the ability to perform unskilled labor
                              (requiring less than 2 years of training or experience).
                           </li>
                           <li>The work should not be of a temporary or seasonal nature.
                              You must be performing work for which qualified workers are not
                              available in the United States.
                           </li>
                           <li>Labor certification and a permanent, full-time job offer are required.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="fs18 lineheight33 mb15 poppins brand-color">3. Labor Certification:</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>Third preference petitions generally require an approved, individual labor
                              certification from the Department of Labor (Form ETA-9089).
                           </li>
                           <li>In some cases, the petition may be submitted to U.S. Citizenship and
                              Immigration Service (USCIS) with an uncertified ETA-9089 for
                              consideration as Schedule A, Group I.
                           </li>

                        <ul>
                        <li>
                           Your employer (petitioner) must file a Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for
                           Alien Workers on your behalf.

                        <p class="fs18 lineheight33 mb15 comfortaa">Remember that the EB-3 visa provides a pathway to permanent residency and access to social
                           and economic benefits. If you’re an unskilled worker, ensure that your job offer aligns with
                           the requirements and that no qualified U.S. workers are available for the position.

                           industries. For instance, the construction industry is experiencing a significant workforce

                           facing challenges due to demographic shifts, such as an aging workforce and declining labor
                           force participation rates. This trend suggests that the U.S. will experience an ongoing
                           shortage of workers, making hiring challenging for years to come. The Bureau of Labor

                           U.S. has 9.5 million job openings but only 6.5 million unemployed workers. Even if every unemployed person found a job, there would still be nearly 3 million open jobs, highlighting
                           a significant gap between employer demand for new hires and the supply of candidates.
