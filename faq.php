                <p class="fs18 lineheight33 mb20 comfortaa"><span class="brand-color uppercaes fw600">1. Check for Registration:</span> Ensure the consultant is registered with the College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants (CICC) or a Canadian provincial or territorial law society, or the Chambre des notaires
                     du Québec for Canada. Similar registrations can also be looked up on Govt. of India websites for authenticity. </p>
                 <p class="fs18 lineheight33 mb20 comfortaa"><span class="brand-color uppercaes fw600">2. Verify Contact Information:</span> Cross-check the contact details on the consultant's website with their Google search results and verify their physical address.</p>
                 <p class="fs18 lineheight33 mb20 comfortaa"><span class="brand-color uppercaes fw600">3. Look for a Secure Website:</span>  Ensure the website has a padlock icon in the address bar and starts with "https://".</p> 
                    <p class="fs18 lineheight33 mb20 comfortaa"><span class="brand-color uppercaes fw600">4. Check for Red Flags:</span>   Be aware of consultants who offer special deals, or have no contact information on their website.</p> 
                    <p class="fs18 lineheight33 mb20 comfortaa"><span class="brand-color uppercaes fw600">5. Check for Reviews:</span>   Look for reviews and testimonials from previous clients on the consultant's website and social media presence.</p>   
                    <p class="fs18 lineheight33 mb20 comfortaa"><span class="brand-color uppercaes fw600">6. One-on-One Consultation:</span>    Reputable consultants will offer a one-on-one consultation before offering a contract.</p>   
                <p class="fs18 lineheight33 mb20 comfortaa">Remember, it is your decision to hire a consultant, and doing so will not guarantee special attention or approval of your application.</p>

                 <p class="fs18 lineheight33 mb20 comfortaa"><span class="brand-color uppercaes fw600">2. Phone Calls: </span> Fraudsters may call, pretending to be from an immigration office, and ask for payment or personal information.</p>
                 <p class="fs18 lineheight33 mb20 comfortaa"><span class="brand-color uppercaes fw600">3. Fake Immigration Websites:</span>   Scammers can create websites that mimic official immigration portals, offering faster processing or guaranteed entry.</p> 
                    <p class="fs18 lineheight33 mb20 comfortaa"><span class="brand-color uppercaes fw600">4. Unsolicited Emails or Phone Calls:</span>  Unsolicited emails or phone calls from someone claiming to be an immigration representative should be treated with caution.</p> 
                    <p class="fs18 lineheight33 mb20 comfortaa"><span class="brand-color uppercaes fw600">5. **False Promises**:</span>   Be wary of consultants who promise guaranteed entry, faster processing, or special deals.</p>   
                    <p class="fs18 lineheight33 mb20 comfortaa"><span class="brand-color uppercaes fw600">6. Lack of a Contact Page:</span>     A website without a contact page or invalid contact information may be a scam.</p>  
                    <p class="fs18 lineheight33 mb20 comfortaa"><span class="brand-color uppercaes fw600">7. No SSL Certificate:</span>   Websites that do not display a lock icon in the address bar or start with "https://" may not be secure.</p>  
                    <p class="fs18 lineheight33 mb20 comfortaa"><span class="brand-color uppercaes fw600">8. Unauthorized Representatives:</span>  Be sure to work with authorized professionals which offer their services at reasonable/low cost and are registered with Govt. of India bodies.</p>  
                    <p class="fs18 lineheight33 mb20 comfortaa"><span class="brand-color uppercaes fw600">9. Fraudulent Documents:</span>  Scammers may provide false or fake documents, such as confirmation letters, biometrics instruction letters, or passport request letters.</p>

              <p class="fs18 lineheight33 mb30 comfortaa">When hiring an immigration consultant or global mobility provider, be aware of the following red flags:</p>
              <p class="fs18 lineheight33 mb20 comfortaa">1. **Lack of Proper Authorization**: Ensure the consultant is registered with the College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants (CICC) or a Canadian provincial or territorial law society, or the Chambre des notaires du Québec for Canada. Other countries have their own Immigration Department websites online which candidates should navigate. </p>
                 <p class="fs18 lineheight33 mb20 comfortaa">2. **Guaranteeing Success**: Be cautious of consultants who guarantee a successful visa, work permit, or permanent residence application, as no person can guarantee the success of your immigration application. </p>
                 <p class="fs18 lineheight33 mb20 comfortaa">3. **No Retainer Agreement or Contract**: A retainer agreement outlines the services provided, payment structure, and client responsibilities. </p> 
                    <p class="fs18 lineheight33 mb20 comfortaa">4. **Asking for a Lot of Money Up Front**: Be wary of consultants who ask for a large amount of money upfront without a consultation. Consultation fees should be conjugant to delivery of services to candidates. </p> 
                    <p class="fs18 lineheight33 mb20 comfortaa">5. **Lack of Transparency**: Be cautious of consultants who are vague or evasive when answering your questions or fail to provide clear information about their fees, services, or processes.</p>   
                    <p class="fs18 lineheight33 mb20 comfortaa">6. **Negative Reviews or Complaints**: Check for reviews and testimonials from previous clients, and be aware of any complaints or disciplinary actions against the consultant.</p>  
                    <p class="fs18 lineheight33 mb20 comfortaa">7. **Promises of Guaranteed Success or Fast Processing**: Be skeptical of consultants who make unrealistic promises or guarantees regarding your immigration outcome.</p>  
                    <p class="fs18 lineheight33 mb20 comfortaa">8. **Unverified Credentials**: Always verify the consultant's credentials with the relevant regulatory bodies.</p>  
                    <p class="fs18 lineheight33 mb20 comfortaa">9. **Lack of Official Documents**: Ensure the representative provides proper documentation throughout the immigration process to avoid fraudulent behaviour.</p> 
                    <p class="fs18 lineheight33 mb20 comfortaa">**Services Offered Outside of Professional Offices**: Be cautious of representatives who conduct meetings in non-professional settings.</p>  
                <p class="fs18 lineheight33 mb20 comfortaa">Remember, the best way to protect yourself from fraud is to use a consultant with a demonstrated record of success and to be aware of these red flags.</p>
